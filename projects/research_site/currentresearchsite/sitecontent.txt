Fiscal Year 2010 Annual Report

COOKIN' WITH M.J.
Celebrating a Record Year

In 2010, the Office of Research and Commercialization at UCF celebrated a major accomplishment - UCF researchers accrued $1.05 billion in research-related funding since 2000.

In those 11 years, our researchers increased funding, were ranked four times on national top 10 lists for the strength of our patents, and built-with the help of our community partners-a nationally recognized entrepreneurship ecosystem that has resulted in more than 1,600 jobs and a $200 million annual economic impact.  UCF has also celebrated 11 classes of millionaires, researchers who have attracted $1 million or more in funding in a fiscal year.  UCF's millionaires have collectively received $507 million in funding since 2000.

We achieved these milestones by aligning our key areas of research with our region's and our state's economy. Over the years, we have developed some of the nation's strongest concentrations in lasers and options, simulation and training, computer science, alternative energy, biomedical science, nanoscience and materials, among other areas.

A significant part of the growth is due to efforts to commercialize the research conducted at UCF.  Our associate vice president for research and founder of the UCF Business Incubation Program, Dr. Tom O'Neal, is largely responsible for these efforts that lead to the formation of Central Florida companies and jobs, as well as national recognition for the strength of our research.

UCF generated a 268 percent increase in annual funding since 2000 and a record $133.3 million in funding in 2010 from outside sponsors.  Last year also produced the largest-ever class of millionaires, 41 researchers, and a record $75.8 million in federal funding.

The Florida Solar Energy Center received the highest funding of all UCF units with $21.2 million, largely as a result of a $10 million program geared toward equipping schools with energy-efficient roofs and the administration of a separate training program for using solar energy in southern states.  The College of Engineering and Computer Science received the second-highest funding amount at UCF with $16.7 million and the Institute for Simulation and Training followed with $15.3 million.

In 2005, when UCF first crossed the $100 million mark for research funding, we started what has become a tradition - rewarding our winning research team with bottles of "MJ's Special Blend" hot sauce.  IT's a tradition that appeals to my Cajun upbringing but also speaks to UCF's red hot research potential.  If you haven't tasted it, stop by my office and grab a bottle.  And for the decade ahead: Laissez les bon temps roulez!

Cheers!

A Strong Decade -
AN EVEN STRONGER YEAR

UCF recently celebrated its research accomplishments at a fitting location—the Stadium Club at UCF's Bright House Networks Stadium. And there's a lot to celebrate.

After a decade of consistent funding increases, UCF researchers received a record $133.3 million from outside sponsors in 2010—an increase of nine percent from FY 2009. Even more impressive, researchers were awarded a cumulative $1.05 billion in funding since FY 2000.

"While we talk every year about the significance of research funding on the local and state economy, it became dramatically apparent this year, when we crossed the billion dollar mark in funding during an 11-year period, that we really had something to celebrate," said M.J. Soileau, UCF's vice president for Research and Commercialization.

At the event, the football-themed music (including the "Zombie Nation" soundtrack made popular at UCF Knights football games), appearances by UCF Athletics Director Keith Tribble and Knightro (the UCF mascot), and the listing of the funding on the scoreboard got more than 200 attendees excited about the milestones the university has reached throughout the last 11 years. Following another long-standing tradition, everyone was given a bottle of "MJ's Special Blend" hot sauce in appreciation of their efforts.

Patents
IN GOOD COMPANY
2010 Rankings Affirm Quality and Quantity of UCF Patents

For the fourth time in the last three years, the power of patents earned by UCF research has been ranked among the 10 strongest in the nation.  The rankings underscore the effectiveness of UCF's strategy.  These accomplishments include:

- Ranked third by the IEEE, the world's largest professional association for the advancement of technology-a rise from eighth in 2008 and seventh in 2009
- Ranked eighth on the Patent Board's Patent Scorecard, joining MIT and the California Institute of Technology
- Tied for fourth for the industry impact of its patents, despite its lower number of patents-a sign that UCF discoveries are strong
