                            <h4>New Proposal Information</h4>
                            <p>NSF and NIH have instituted important proposal changes effective this month.
                            You can read about the latest NSF clarifications here: 
                            <a href="main.html">NSF GPG Summary</a></p>
                            <p>In addition, effective January 25, NIH, AHRQ and NIOSH have eliminated the 
                            error correction window for applications. For further information on this 
                            important change, see: <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-10-123.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-10-123.html</a></p>
                            <p>And, effective January 1, NSF is requiring a supplement describing data management. 
                            This is similar to the postdoc mentoring requirement, except it is a supplement and not 
                            required in the proposal. This supplement should describe how the proposal will conform
                            to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results.</p>
