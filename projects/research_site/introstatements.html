                        	<p>In 2010, the Office of Research and Commercialization at UCF celebrated a major accomplishment - 
                            UCF researchers accrued $1.05 billion in research-related funding since 2000.</p>
                            
                            <p>In those 11 years, our researchers increased funding, were ranked four times on national top 10 
                            lists for the strength of our patents, and built-with the help of our community partners-a nationally 
                            recognized entrepreneurship ecosystem that has resulted in more than 1,600 jobs and a $200 million annual 
                            economic impact.  UCF has also celebrated 11 classes of millionaires, researchers who have attracted $1 
                            million or more in funding in a fiscal year.  UCF's millionaires have collectively received $507 million 
                            in funding since 2000.</p>
                            
                            <p>We achieved these milestones by aligning our key areas of research with our region's and our state's 
                            economy. Over the years, we have developed some of the nation's strongest concentrations in lasers and 
                            options, simulation and training, computer science, alternative energy, biomedical science, nanoscience 
                            and materials, among other areas.</p>
                            
                            <p>A significant part of the growth is due to efforts to commercialize the research conducted at UCF.  
                            Our associate vice president for research and founder of the UCF Business Incubation Program, Dr. Tom O'Neal, 
                            is largely responsible for these efforts that lead to the formation of Central Florida companies and jobs, 
                            as well as national recognition for the strength of our research.</p>
                            
                            <p>UCF generated a 268 percent increase in annual funding since 2000 and a record $133.3 million 
                            in funding in 2010 from outside sponsors.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div id="bottommidright">
                    		<p>Last year also produced the largest-ever class of millionaires, 
                            41 researchers, and a record $75.8 million in federal funding.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Florida Solar Energy Center received the highest funding of all UCF units with $21.2 million, largely 
                            as a result of a $10 million program geared toward equipping schools with energy-efficient roofs and the administration 
                            of a separate training program for using solar energy in southern states.  The College of Engineering and Computer 
                            Science received the second-highest funding amount at UCF with $16.7 million and the Institute for Simulation and 
                            Training followed with $15.3 million.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 2005, when UCF first crossed the $100 million mark for research funding, we started what has become a 
                            tradition - rewarding our winning research team with bottles of "MJ's Special Blend" hot sauce.  IT's a tradition 
                            that appeals to my Cajun upbringing but also speaks to UCF's red hot research potential.  If you haven't tasted it, 
                            stop by my office and grab a bottle.  And for the decade ahead: Laissez les bon temps roulez!</p>
                            
                            <p>Cheers!</p>
