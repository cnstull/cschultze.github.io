                    	<img class="cimg" src="img/videogamecriteria.png" alt="Video Game Criteria" /><br />
						<ul class="criteria">
							<li>It must allow for some imagination.</li>
							<li>It must be suspenseful.</li>
							<li>It must be challenging.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p class="m4x"><strong>Concept:</strong></p>

                            <li>The video game I hope to make will be a Star Wars fighting game. It will be an "old school" arcade style fighting game with various characters to choose from. You will be able to duel each other one-on-one, either against other players or against the computer. There will be different combo attacks, and attacks will be different depending on the character - some characters will have different lightsabers and will have different Force attacks. There will also be a story mode for single player, and it will allow you to play as different characters to see the story from their point of view, and battle different characters resepctively. In some story mode battles, you will go up against several different enemies at a time, so it won't always be one-on-one. </li>
							
							
							<p><img class="left" src="img/videogame3.png" alt="Videogame Screenshot" /></p>
							<li>You also won't just have to play as Jedi. You can also play as other characters such as Han Solo or Princess Leia, and they will be able to fight with guns and blasters. For example, the story may begin in the cantina when you play as Han Solo, and you will have to begin a gun fight with Greedo. The game won't follow much for backstory, or what happened off of the big screen. The stories for each character will mostly follow how you see them and are introduced to them in the movies, so you will only face other characters and enemies from the films.</li>
