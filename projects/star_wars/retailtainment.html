					<img class="cimg" src="img/retailcriteria.png" alt="Retailtainment Criteria" /><br />
						<ul class="criteria">
                        	<li>It has to be enjoyable to go to regularly.</li>
                            <li>It has to allow the imagination to work.</li>
                            <li>It must teach enough to not alienate non-enthusiasts.</li>
                            <li>It must be for all ages.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p class="m4x"><strong>Concept:</strong></p>
						<ul class="concepts">
                        	<li>My retailtainment center will be an outdoor shopping mall that's just about entirely Star Wars themed. It will have various stores and places where people can grab a bite to eat. Some restaurants will be more casual than others, and there will also be some smaller shops and concession stands for snacks and really quick eats. Some of the shops will carry general Star Wars merchandise, but there will also be smaller sspecialty shops for unique items and experiences.</li>
                            
                        	<p><img class="right" src="img/cloudcity.jpg" alt="Cloud City Restaurant" /></p>
                        	<li><strong>Cloud City Restaurant:</strong> The Cloud City Restaurant will be one of the focal points of the center. It will be a very tall structure, and will bring guests up to the main restaurant area by elevator. Reservations and accomodations will be made at the base of the tower to save on unnecessary traffic to and from the tower. The tower will be a sit-down restaurant that slowly revovles, so guests can get a good view of their surroundings without just having to face out a window in one direction the entire time. The elevators, kitchen, and bathrooms will remain fixed in the center, while the tables will essentially be on a donut shape that slowly turns. The menu will be fairly casual, featuring burgers, sandwiches, steaks, and more.</li>
                            <br />
                            
                            <p><img class="left" src="img/lightsabershop.png" alt="Lightsaber Shop" /></p>
                            <li><strong>Lightsaber Shop:</strong> The lightsaber shop will be a smaller specialty shop that allows guests to build their own custom lightsaber. The shop will have bins of various parts in all different shapes, sizes, and colors. You will be able to choose your blade color, hilt, and more. There will be a couple of options: a simpler option with less parts for children to build, and a more complex option with more complex parts for adults, more advanced children, or other enthusiasts. The simpler side will be along one wall, while the more complex side will be along the opposite wall. Customers will be charged for their lightsaber depending on the parts used. It will also sell extra accessories such as stands for you to place your lightsaber on when you're not using it.</li>
                            <br />
                            
                            <p><img class="right" src="img/store.png" alt="Star Wars Store" /></p>
                            <li><strong>Star Wars Store:</strong> The Star Wars Store will be a very large store within the retail center. It will be one of the main attractions since it will attract a wide audience, offering all sorts of Star Wars merchandise for all ages. The front of the store will look like the Death Star, and it will be two stories tall. The inside will sell plushies, toy lightsabers, shirts, coffee mugs, and more. People will be able to interact with a lot of the merchandise, such as playing with lightsabers before buying, or test running remote controlled droid toys.</li>
                            <br /><br />
                            
                            <p><img class="left" src="img/jeditraining.jpg" alt="Jedi Training" /></p>
							<li><strong>Young Jedi Training:</strong> Enroll your child to become a Jedi. Your little Padawans will get their own Jedi garb along with their very own lightsaber to practice with. They will be taught the way of the Jedi through concepts and hands-on training. They will learn how to wield the lightsaber and also begin their training with The Force by learning how to trust their instincts and rely on their senses.</li>
