				<h4>Family Entertainment Center:</h4>
					<p class="m4x"><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong></p>
					<img class="cimg" src="img/entertainmentcriteria.png" alt="Family Entertainment Criteria" /><br />
						<ul class="criteria">
							<li>It must be affordable.</li>
							<li>It must have simple fun.</li>
							<li>It must be casual.</li>
							<li>It must be convenient to draw regular customers.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p class="m4x"><strong>Concept:</strong></p>
						<ul class="concepts">
							
							<li>The Star Wars family entertainment center will be a casual place for families and friends to gather. It will be affordable enough for people to return regularly, and not just visit on special ocassions (like birthdays). It will appeal to a wide audience of ages, and include activites that appeal to both children and adults. Some of the main attractions will include food, indoor laser tag, an arcade, indoor bowling, outdoor mini golf, and indoor play equipment (mostly for the kids).</li>
							
							<p><img class="right" src="img/food.png" alt="Food" /></p>
							<li><strong>Food:</strong> The family entertainment center will have to serve food in order to get people to come and stay for extended periods. It will be open during lunch and dinner hours, so it won't serve breakfast. It be very casual dining, and allow people to bring the food to various locations around the center, so they can set up a designated ares to hangout with their friends or family. The kitchen and ordering area will be located in the center of the indoor complex, allowing people to easily access food regardless of what activity they may be focusing on. Menu items will include various pizzas, salads, burgers, French fries, fountain drinks, cookies, other snacks and more.</li>
							<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
							
							<p><img class="left" src="img/lasertag.png" alt="Laser Tag" /></p>
							<li><strong>Indoor Laser Tag:</strong> The laser tag will be based indoors, allowing people to play in the dark both during the day and at night. It will feature two main areas inside, representing "bases" that two opposing teams can use - the Rebels and the Empire. Structures inside will be two stories tall, but will be use ramps instead of stairs so people don't trip in the dark. Lighting will be sparse, and will consist mostly of "black" lighting (UV bulbs). Almost everything such as the walls, floor, and ceiling will be painted black, with stars painted in day-glow paint all over, and the ocassional painting of a starship (X-wings, TIE fighters, etc). Players will have to wear a large vest that has laser sensors on the shoulders, front, and back, which has the blaster gun tethered to it with a wire.</li>
							<br /><br />
							
							<p><img class="right" src="img/podracer.jpg" alt="Star Wars Pod Racer" /></p>
							<li><strong>Arcade:</strong> The arcade will be like a typical arcade, including various forms of games. There will be classic arcade cabinets such as Pacman and Galaga, as well as more modern fighting games like Marvel vs Capcom or Street Fighter. There will also be a focus on Star Wars games, such as the Pod Racer arcade. Other games will be more physical such as air hockey tables and billiards tables. Instead of requiring tokens or quarters to play, guests will be able to add credits to a card through a machine, which will take cash and credit cards for convenience. It will also keep track of virtual tickets which can be redeemed for prizes, more credits, or food.</li>
							<br /><br />
							
							<p><img class="left" src="img/bowling.png" alt="R2-D2 Bowling" /></p>
							<li><strong>Indoor Bowling:</strong> The bowling alley will be included inside the main indoor complex. It will have at least 50 lanes to accomodate a lot of guests, but not too many since there are also several other activities for people to be doing. There will be attendants at a counter where people can pay for games and rent shoes, like a typical bowling alley. Guests will also be allowed to bring food over to their lanes, as long as they don't take it beyond a certain line (designated on the floor) to avoid any spills and crumbs on the slippery bowling surface. There will be "normal" games going on during the day and early evening, but after 9 PM, there will be more "party" games where the games are play regularly, but the lighting will be "black" light based and the music will be louder.</li>
							<br /><br />
							
							<p><img class="right" src="img/minigolf2.png" alt="Star Wars Mini Golf" /></p>
							<li><strong>Outdoor Mini Golf:</strong> The outdoor mini golf will be the usual 18 holes. There will be a few attendants at a small structure where guests will be able to pay and choose their putter and ball. The balls will be Star Wars themed, and will look like Stormtrooper helmets, Darth Vader's helmet, Yoda, and other character heads. Each hole will be thoroughly decorated to represent the various venues in the Star Wars movies. For example, a hole and the surrounding turf may be decorated like Tattooine, with sand-colored "grass," while another may have tall trees around it along with a pond and a half-submerged X-Wing to look like Dagobah.</li>
							<br /><br />
							
							<p><img class="left" src="img/gokarts.png" alt="Starship Go Karts" /></p>
							<li><strong>Starship Go Karts:</strong> A family entertainment complex isn't complete without go karts. The go karts will each look like different starships, mostly X-Wings and TIE Fighters. The track will look like the outside of the Death Star as they race to be the first to the exhaust port. Each race will be three laps long, and will run for approximately 10 minutes total. There will be a dozen racers at a time, 6 Rebels and 6 Imperials.</li>
							<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
							
							
                            
                            <p><img class="right" src="img/playarea3.png" alt="Caution: Sarlacc Pit" /></p>
							<li><strong>Indoor Play Area:</strong> For the littler kids, there will also be an indoor play area. This will include lots of slides and tubes for the kids to climb in and on, along with a ball pit (Sarlacc Pit) and zip line. It will also have monkey bars, and just about everything will be covered in foam padding so that children won't hurt themselves on exposed metal bars or any sharp corners.</li>
