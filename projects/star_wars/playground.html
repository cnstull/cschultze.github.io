							<li>It must allow children to use their imagination.</li>
							<li>It must be fun.</li>
						</ul>

                        	<li>The playground will incorporate several Star Wars inspired structures and elements. While inspired, they will still be basic enough for children to "figure out" and play around on without the chance of them severely hurting themselves. The main area of the playground will be made up of a soft, rubbery material. It will be colored black with a spacey star pattern all over. Structures for the children to play on will include smaller replicas of star ships such as X-Wings or other walkers such as AT-TEs. The X-Wing will only be able to have one child sit inside of it at a time and be able to see out the clear bubble. Other structures like the AT-TE will be larger to accomodate several children at once, where they can gather to talk, plot their "attack," or just get out of the sun for a while.</li>
                            
                            <p><img class="left" src="img/vaderswings.jpg" alt="Vader Swings" /></p>
                            <li>Other things for the kids to do will include small, bouncy creatures such as Tauntauns for the smaller children, along with a Milennium Falcon merry-go-round. There will be other basic equipment such as a swingset and slides. Benches will be scattered around the perimeter of the playing area for kids to take a break on, or for parents to sit and watch their children. There will be few trees, allowing for some shade, but also for enough open playing room, along with a fence around the perimeter (behind the benches) for safety.</li>
