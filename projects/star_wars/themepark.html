                                <li><strong>Dueling Jedi Rollercoaster:</strong> Two rollercoasters launch simultaneously to "battle." One coaster represents the Jedi Order, and will be painted green and blue. This coaster will be known for having many more loops, corkscrews, and turns, but won't read top speeds that its rival coaster will. This coaster is all about precision and accuracy. The opposing coaster will represent the Sith, who are also Jedi, but are evil and more concerned with power. Because of this hunger for power the coaster will go much faster than the Jedi one, and will have fewer but more dramatic turns and loops. It will be painted red and black to make it easily distinguishable from the other.</li>
                                
                                <p><img class="left" src="img/ewokvillage.jpg" alt="Ewok Village" /></p>
                                <li><strong>Ewok Village:</strong> The Ewok village will be a place in the park targeted at children. It will mostly be a playground area with both fake and real trees everywhere, allowing for much canopy cover and shade. Some larger trees will be connected with rope bridges and rope tunnels so children can easily get from tree to tree. Inside some of the larger false trees will be places to sit, lookout holes, or small hands-on activites such as large puzzles or tic-tac-toe. On the ground, there will be some more typical playground equipment such as a Death Star merry-go-round, swings, bouncy Guapas (Ewok ponies), and slides.</li>
                                <br /><br />
                                
                                <p><img class="right" src="img/battles.jpg" alt="Reenacted Scenes" /></p>
                                <li><strong>Scene Reenactment Show:</strong> Your favorite scenes from the original Trilogy are reenacted in this lively show. Beginning with Luke on the moisture farm on Tattooine, all the way to the fight against Darth Vader, major events from the film series will be acted out live in front of an audience. The onlookers will be seated in stadium seating, but the stage will be changing throughout the show depending on the scene being depicted. There will be several showings throughout the day.</li>
                                <br /><br /><br />
                                
                                <p><img class="left" src="img/cantina.jpg" alt="Anchorhead Cantina" /></p>
                                <li><strong>Anchorhead Cantina:</strong> Sit down and relax with some food and live music. The cantina will resemble the Anchorhead Cantina from Tattooine in the movies. It will incorporate a live band of Bith playing various Star Wars songs. The food and drinks served will be reminiscent of the Star Wars universe as well, including items such as blue milk, Wookie cookies, frozen carbonite bars (ice cream sandwiches), and more. The menu will mostly consist of "quick eats," such as drinks and snacks, but will also serve some more substantial staples and affordable options such as pizza and chicken tenders.</li>
								
								<p><img class="right" src="img/starshipbattle.jpg" alt="Starship Battle" /></p>
								<li><strong>Starship Battle:</strong> The Starship Battle ride will simulate a space battle while engaging the riders. Each car will look like a Rebel X-Wing and hold two guests. It will not be entirely enclosed, and each rider will have their own laser blaster to aim and shoot in front of them, moving along slowly on a set track. Various star ships will be moving around them with targets on them. Smaller ships such as TIE fighters will only take a single "hit," while larger ships such as Star Destroyers will take several hits before being destroyed. Since the ride will be indoors and be fairly dark to represent space, when a ship is shot down, it will no longer light up so it looks like it's gone. The car will keep score of each rider's points, and will also add their scores together so they can see how each car compared in a high score table on a large screen at the end of the ride.</li>
								<br />
								
								<p><img class="left" src="img/spaceslug.png" alt="Space Slug Shooter" /></p>
								<li><strong>Space Slug Shooter:</strong> This ride will hold about a dozen people. It will be a large ship that looks like the Milennium Falcon. It will go along a set track through space for a while until it comes upon an asteroid. On that asteroid will be the Space Slug, which will engulf the Milennium Falcon and try to eat it. To represent being eaten, the ship will then be dropped, free falling into the Space Slug's mouth, jerking up and down and all around for a while, before shooting back out into space again to escape.</li>
                            </ul>
