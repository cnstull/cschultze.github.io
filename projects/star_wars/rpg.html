				<h4>Role Playing Game:</h4>
					<p class="m4x"><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong></p>
					<img class="cimg" src="img/rpgcriteria.png" alt="Role Playing Game Criteria" /><br />
						<ul class="criteria">
							<li>It must be imaginative.</li>
							<li>It must be funny.</li>
							<li>It must reference the films.</li>
							<li>It must be easy to pick up.</li>
							<li>It must allow players to help or hurt each other.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p class="m4x"><strong>Concept:</strong></p>
						<ul class="concepts">
							<p><img class="cimg" src="img/rpg.png" alt="Star Wars Cards" /></p>
							<li>The Star Wars card game will be a standard tabletop game. It will be played with only cards and ocassionally a couple die. Various game pieces will be included to represent each player, shaped like little figures of characters from the Star Wars movies, such as Obi-Wan, Luke, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, etc. Each player will then be the race of each piece (human, wookie, ewok, etc), but will be able to also have a class, decided from cards. The cards will be included in the deck, and will be random, but can also be changed during gameplay.</li>
							
							<p><img class="right" src="img/rpg2.png" alt="Star Wars Card Game" /></p>
							<li>The cards will be divided into two main piles, the loot pile and the event pile. The loot pile will have various items that people will be able to use as items, which can benefit them and aid them in battles. Some cards will be equipped as long as the player would like, and others will only be able to be used once, which will be denoted on the card. </li>
                            
                            <br /><br />
                            <li>Players can play as long as they like. The game is very lenient and allows the players to set rules such as this. Most common games will be played to 10 or 20 "levels." Each player's character will start off on level one, and they will gain levels from defeating enemies in the event pile, and can gain levels under certain circumstances when they aid other players as well. The game pieces will be move on a board that is a grid of numbers in order, allowing the players to just slide their character to a new number, representing their current level. This makes it easier for players to keep track of what level they currently are and everyone playing can keep track of who is currently in the lead or not.</li>
