				<h4>About Me</h4>
                <img class="chars" src="img/profileImage.jpg" alt="Corrinne" />
                
                <p class="bio">Hello, I'm Corrinne Schultze. I am currently a student at the University of Central Florida majoring in Digital Media and working for the Techrangers. My focus is on web design and development, and I also have a studio art minor. My strengths lie in front-end design with HTML and CSS, but I am forever expanding my knowledge of scripting and programming. I also enjoy practicing both digital and traditional art, and am always willing to try a new medium.</p>
                
                <p class="bio">I decided to major in digital media because technology has been an important part of my life. I grew up with video games in my home and bonded with my brother and cousins by playing these games together, and in turn, all sharing the same interests. As a child, my parents had an Atari 2600 and a Nintendo Entertainment System. Ever since, I have been on the brink of new console and game releases, and have also expanded my interests to computer games.
                
                <p class="bio">After having a hand-me-down Macintosh computer for years, my family finally bought our first computer in 2001. Immediately, I was hooked, and began catching up on the wonderful world of games and technology that I had missed. With this computer, we also finally had Internet access, and my life in the revolutionary technologic world kept changing.</p>
                
                <p class="bio">By the time I made it to high school, I was taking beginning web design and programming classes, and have been hooked since. For years I have been practicing HTML, CSS, and more, and continue to expand my knowledge by learning more techniques, scripting languages, and programming languages. I also am minoring in studio art, so I enjoy traditional art as well as digital art and graphic design. I get a thrill out of experimenting with new media, both on and off the computer.</p>
                
                <p class="bio">I enjoy a lot of physical and hands-on activities, so I'm constantly moving to keep myself active and entertained. While I spend a lot of my time indoors drawing, web designing, doing arts and crafts, playing video games and more, I also try to balance it by going outdoors and hiking, bicycling, and all-around trying new things. I'm adventurous and like to try new things constantly!</p>
