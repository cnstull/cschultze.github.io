				<h2 class="policiesHeader">Tax Policy</h2>
				<p class="policiesMessage">Applicable sales tax will be charged on total merchandise for orders shipped within New York State.</p>
				<h2 class="policiesHeader">Return Policy</h2>
				<p class="policiesMessage">All sales are final. Many of the products we sell are collectible items, therefore we do not accept returns or exchanges. It is possible that you may find slight variations or blemishes with your product. This is because many of the items are hand-assembled and/or hand-painted. Also, some of our stock is imported from overseas and is not readily available in North America. Due to international shipping costs and the uniqueness of the products, our inventory on each item is very small, and most products are made in limited runs. For these reasons we hope you understand our no returns policy. Thanks!</p>
				<h2 class="policiesHeader">Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p class="policiesMessage">Hi-Fi Octopii respects your personal information. We do not give out any information to third parties, marketing companies, etc. We also do not sell, rent, barter or trade any of your personal information.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site simply to make online orders possible and to enhance your overall shopping experience. Again, Hi-Fi Octopii does not sell, rent, barter or trade any of your personal information to others.</p>
				<h2 class="policiesHeader">Security Statement</h2>
				<p class="policiesMessage">Hi-Fi Octopii utilizes some of the most advanced technology for Internet security available today. When you access our site using industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, your information is protected using both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to registered Users in your organization. Your data will be completely inaccessible to your competitors.

Hi-Fi Octopii provides each User in your organization with a unique user name and password that must be entered each time a User logs on. Hi-Fi Octopii issues a session cookie only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session cookie does not include either the username or password of the user. Salesforce.com does not use cookies to store other confidential user and session information, but instead implements more advanced security methods based on dynamic data and encoded session IDs.

In addition, Hi-Fi Octopii is hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.</p>
